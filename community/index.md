You can:

* Use our project and provide feedback.
* Provide us with the use-cases.

Please make sure you are subscribed to the mailing list you are posting to!

If you are not subscribed to the mailing list, your message will either be rejected or you won't receive the response.

### How to subscribe to a mailing list

Before you can post a message to a mailing list, you need to subscribe to the list first.

1. Send an email without any contents or subject to listname-subscribe@graphar.apache.org. (replace listname with dev or user)
2. Wait till you receive an email with the subject "confirm subscribe to listname@graphar.apache.org". Reply to that email, without editing the subject or including any contents.
3. Wait till you receive an email with the subject "WELCOME to listname@graphar.apache.org".

If you email us with a code snippet, make sure that:

* you do not link to files in external services as such files can change, get deleted or the link might break and thus make an archived email thread useless
* you paste text instead of screenshots of text
* you keep formatting when pasting code to keep the code readable
* there are enough import statements to avoid ambiguities

### Tag Convention

The mailing list follow the convention of prefixing subjects with one or more tags in order to
clarify the scope and purpose of messages. For example:

- [ANNOUNCE] GraphAr 0.1.0 released
- [DISCUSS][C++] How to implement a new API in C++?
- [DISCUSS][Format] How to support partition pruning?
- [Spark][Reader] Support the push-down of filters

When emailing to the mail list, please prefix the subject line with one or more tags.
Depending the topic of your email, tags may include one or more:

- Supported Environments: e.g., [C++], [Spark], [Java], etc.
- Specifications: e.g., [Format], [Reader], [Writer], [API], etc.

You may also prefix your subject line with [DISCUSS] if your email is intended to prompt a discussion
rather than get an answer to a specific question.

## Issue tracker

We use GitHub Issues to track all code related issues: https://github.com/apache/incubator-graphar/issues

You must have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to log cases and issues.

### Bug reports

Found bug? Enter an issue in the issue tracker.

Before submitting an issue, please:

* Verify that the bug does in fact exist.
* Search the issue tracker to verify there is no existing issue reporting the bug you've found.
* Consider tracking down the bug yourself in the source code of GraphAr and submitting a patch along with your bug report. This is a great time saver for the GraphAr developers and helps ensure the bug will be fixed quickly.

### Enhancement

Enhancements or new feature proposals are also welcome. The more concrete and rationale the proposal is, the greater the chance it will be incorporated into future releases.

## Source code

* GraphAr core repository: https://github.com/apache/graphar

## Community Meeting

We host a online meeting to provide spaces for synchronous discussions about the GraphAr project.
During the meeting, we will cover various topics including project status, roadmap updates, and other relevant discussions.

The community meeting runs weekly, every Tuesday at 7:00 PM (UTC+8).

See the [community meeting notes](https://github.com/apache/incubator-graphar/wiki/GraphAr-Weekly-Community-Meeting) for the next meeting.

For now, we have a single community event known as the Community Sync Meeting.
This meeting is open to everyone.

## People
